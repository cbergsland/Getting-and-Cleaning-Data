There is one R file (run_analysis.R) uploaded to this repository that tidies the data based on the requirements for the assignment. 
To begin with it downloads the data at the following site:

A full description of the data is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The script then goes on to tidy the data and write a .txt file with the tidied data.
A full explanation of the script and description of the variables is provided 
in the CodeBook.md file.
